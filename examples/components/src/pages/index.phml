    phml is python embedded inside of html. This is powerful when used with other libraries
    such as flask. Even when it is used by itself it can be very powerful. This example
    shows proof of that.

  <Callout icon="warning" title="Some warning callout" />

  <p>
    This homepage shows examples of components. The components I created are callouts.
    I can give these custom elements attributes which are used as props for the components.
    Conditional attributes are preserved and placed on the parent wrapper element of the
    component. The `icon` attribute defines the type of icon that is used in the callout.
    the title attribute allows for custom titles, and the message attribute allows for a single
    text node in the children. The component also has a conditional `Slot` element that
    is a placeholder for all the children of the component. All children given to the `Callout`
    component on this page will replace the `Slot` element in the component. Below you will
    see more variations of the callout component.
  </p>

  <Callout icon="info" message="Here is an info message" />

  <Callout icon="danger">
    <p>Callout with children</p>
  </Callout>

  <Callout icon="fail" message="Same callout displaying prop and children">
    <p>Child element</p>
  </Callout>
